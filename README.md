# Brandeis Transportation Coordinator Dashboard

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project provides a **Python Dash** dashboard designed to help the Brandeis Transportation office analyze ridership trends across their campus shuttle routes. By visualizing historical and real-time ridership data, this tool supports data-driven decisions such as:
- Adjusting vehicle capacity
- Modifying service hours
- Identifying under- or over-utilized stops

Additionally, the project required (but not included here) scripts for **data cleaning** and reformatting, tailored to the vendor's data inconsistencies, ensuring that the dashboard receives well-structured, accurate inputs.

## Dashboard Features

### Time-Based Ridership Analysis
The **Time** page allows you to explore ridership across multiple granularities. Available visualizations include:
- Ridership by **semester** and **year**
- Ridership by **month**, **week**, and **date**
- Ridership in **30-min intervals**
- Ridership by **scheduled time** at any selected stop

By default, the dashboard displays ridership trends for the entire date range defined by the filters at the top of the page.

### Stop Utilization
The **Stop Utilization** page highlights which stops are most and least frequented. It includes:
- Top and bottom **10 stops** by ridership (adjustable in code)
- Daily ridership breakdowns for each day of the week across these top and bottom stops

- Redesigned and more visually appealing **home page**
